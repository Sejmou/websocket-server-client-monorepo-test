# tRPC Websocket Server + Tauri Desktop App Client Demo
In this repo I am trying to figure out how to get a project working with tRPC where the server accepts requests via WebSockets and the client is a Desktop App built with Tauri. 

This thing uses `pnpm` so make sure to install it.
## Install
`pnpm i`

Currently, this thing doesn't run out of the box as a `postgres` DB is expected to exist and be linked via `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file?

I will try to remove all the DB-related things (references to postgres + Prisma).


# OLD README from initial template: Prisma + tRPC + WebSockets

Try demo http://websockets.trpc.io/

## Features

- 🧙‍♂️ E2E type safety with [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
- ⚡ Full-stack React with Next.js
- ⚡ WebSockets / Subscription support
- ⚡ Database with Prisma
- 🔐 Authorization using [next-auth](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- ⚙️ VSCode extensions
- 🎨 ESLint + Prettier
- 💚 CI setup using GitHub Actions:
  - ✅ E2E testing with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
  - ✅ Linting

## Setup

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/trpc/trpc --example-path examples/next-prisma-websockets-starter trpc-prisma-websockets-starter
cd trpc-prisma-websockets-starter
pnpm i
pnpm dx
```

## Deployment

### Using [Render](https://render.com/)

The project contains a [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml) [_"Blueprint"_](https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec) which makes the project easily deployable on [Render](https://render.com/).

The database is setup with a `starter` plan, but you can use a free plan for 90 days.

Go to [dashboard.render.com/blueprints](https://dashboard.render.com/blueprints) and connect to this Blueprint and see how the app and database automatically gets deployed.

You will either need to create an environment group called `trpc-websockets` with environment variables or remove that from `render.yaml` in favor of manual environment variables that overrides the ones in `/.env`.
